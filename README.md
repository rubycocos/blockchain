- [elliptic](elliptic) - elliptic curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA) cryptography with OpenSSL made easy (incl. secp256k1 curve)
- [digest-lite](digest-lite) - crypto(graphic) hash functions / classes - Digest::KeccakLite (512bit, 256bit, etc), Digest::SHA3Lite (512bit, 256bit, etc) in "100% pure" ruby "lite" scripts, that is, without any c-extensions and with zero-dependency
- [rlp-lite](rlp-lite) - light-weight ("lite") machinery to serialize / deserialze using the recursive-length prefix (rlp) scheme



<!-- break -->

- [abidoc](abidoc) - application binary interface (abi) documentation generator for Ethereum & Co. (blockchain) contracts
- [abigen](abigen) - generate ready-to-use (blockchain) contract services / function calls for ethereum & co. via application binary inferfaces (abis)
- [ethlite](ethlite) - light-weight machinery to query / call ethereum (blockchain contract) services via json-rpc (incl. tuple support)
- [ethlite-contracts](ethlite-contracts) - pre-packaged ready-to-use "out-of-the-gem" (blockchain) contract services / function calls for ethereum & co
- [etherscan-lite](etherscan-lite) - light-weight machinery / helper for the Etherscan (blockchain) JSON HTTP API / web services (note: API key sign-up required)
- [ethname](ethname) - light-weight crowd-sourced "off-chain" ethereum name to (contract) address service / helper (incl. punks v1,v2,v3,v4; phunks v1,v2, synth punks, punk blocks, etc.)  - yes, you can! - add more names / contracts via git ;-)
- [ethers](ethers) -  "high-level" all-in-one umbrella quick starter gem for easy installation & usage for ethereum & co. (blockchain) contract services in ruby'
